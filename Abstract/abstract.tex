Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNLs) are proposed to be the right-handed heavy partner to the left-handed Standard Model (SM) neutrino, motivated by mechanisms of neutrino mass generation.  
HNLs can be produced from kaon decays in the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) and subsequently decay in the Short-Baseline Near Detector (SBND), producing observable signals.
%This thesis focuses on the HNL channel $N\rightarrow\nu\pi^0$ in the mass range of 140-260 MeV, where the neutral pion decays into di-photon showers inside the detector.
The focus is on HNLs in the mass range of 140-260 MeV, decaying into a neutral pion that results in di-photon showers inside the detector.
SBND is a 112 ton liquid argon time projection chamber, which offers an exceptional energy, spatial and timing resolution. 
The capability of SBND to search for HNLs is assessed in this thesis.
%Two selections of HNLs are presented, with one having more aggressive background rejection than the other. 
Selections of HNLs are presented, exploiting the boosted topology and late arrival features of HNLs compared to SM neutrinos that lead to a background rejection efficiency $\mathcal{O}$(10$^{-4}$) while maintaining $\sim30\%$ of signals. 
An assessment of the detector performance under the assumption of an improved timing reconstruction is also given. 
A treatment of statistical and systematics uncertainties is outlined, followed by a procedure to set upper limits on the coupling $|U_{\mu4}|^2$ of Majorana HNLs at the 90\% confidence level. 
Three result scenarios are presented, demonstrating the current and potential capability of SBND.
