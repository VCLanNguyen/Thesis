This thesis presents the first assessment of the physics capabilities of the Short-Baseline Near Detector (SBND) to search for Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNLs) in the mass range of 140-260 MeV.
This right-handed heavy neutrino state is motivated to provide a mechanism to generate mass for the left-handed SM neutrinos.
HNLs can be produced from the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) from meson decays and subsequently decay into SM observables inside SBND. 
Due to having relatively large masses, the two exploitable features of HNLs are their boosted topologies and late arrival compared to SM neutrinos.
Particularly, the late arrival of HNLs can be observed as an excess in the tails of the Gaussian-shaped neutrino beam bucket.
The bucket structure can be reconstructed using the arrival time with a resolution $\mathcal{O}$(2 ns) from PMT signals, as part of the Photon Detection System (PDS).

Towards this goal of achieving nanosecond resolution, the timing performance of readout electronics in the Data Acquisition (DAQ) was evaluated.
An overview of the White Rabbit timing system was given, including the description of the SPEC-TDC as a precise timestamping device with a resolution of 700 ps to record important signals, including beam arrivals and triggers.
This additional timing information enables many high precision physics analyses.
For instance, the SPEC-TDC was used to perform the timing characterisation of the readout electronics of the Cosmic Ray Taggers (CRTs), of which their clock resolutions were determined to be $\mathcal{O}$(2 ns).
Moreover, the SPEC-TDC was used to assess the timing synchronisation of the readout electronics of the PDS.
This resulted in a clock scheme and a correction method to synchronise multiple digitisers, which are vitally important since PMT signals are the ingredients for the timing reconstruction.

Two selection workflows were additionally developed to identify di-photon showers resulting from HNLs while rejecting backgrounds from SM neutrinos and cosmic muons.
One selection is more lenient while the other is more stringent in rejecting backgrounds more aggressively.
Both selections result in a background efficiency of the same magnitude $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ while still maintaining the signal efficiency at $\sim$30\%.
If only bins at the edge of the arrival time distribution are considered, equivalent to the so-called \textit{timing cut}, the background efficiency decreases by two orders of magnitude to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$ while the signal efficiency only reduces to 10\%. 
The timing cut demonstrates the importance of the edge bins having an exceptionally high signal-to-background ratio, which is the driving factor for a competitive sensitivity.
This motivates an assessment of the detector performance under the assumption of an improved in timing reconstruction, resulting in an additional arrival time distribution by smearing true variables.

Building upon the selection previously discussed, setting upper limits on the coupling $|U_{\mu4}|^2$ of HNLs at the confidence level of 90\% was performed on three sets of arrival time distributions after selection on MC samples: (1) lenient, (2) stringent and (3) smeared truth.  
It was found that the stringent distribution results in a more competitive limit than the lenient distribution due to having background-free bins, however, the stringent limit suffers large statistical fluctuations.
These two limits were found to probe the phase space already explored by the MicroBooNE \cite{uboone1, uboone2, uboone3}, NA62 \cite{NA62A, NA62B} and E949 \cite{E949} experiments.
However, they are the first benchmark of the current physics capability of SBND in the search for HNLs.
Moreover, it was demonstrated that the edge bins of the distribution are the key bins that drive the upper limits.   
The smeared true distribution led to the most competitive limits out of the three, surpassing existing results from other experiments.  

The first iteration of this analysis provides some guidelines applicable to future work.
Detector systematics should be included in uncertainty propagation, with parameters that are impactful to physics measurement identified when SBND is operational.
%Secondly, due to the aggressive background rejection, the analysis should be performed on larger background MC samples, $\mathcal{O}$(10$^6$ events) compared to the presented $\mathcal{O}$(10$^5$ events), to avoid statistical fluctuations.
The results of the smeared true distribution motivate the need for a resolution improvement when reconstructing the arrival time distribution.
The preparation work towards the nanosecond resolution has already begun with the DAQ readout electronics and the implementation of the SPEC-TDC for high precision timestamping.  
A more sophisticated timing reconstruction can be developed incorporating the extra timing information of beam arrival and trigger signals.
This improvement will not only benefit the HNL analysis but any other analysis that exploits the Gaussian tails of the beam bucket to either look for a new signal or to reject cosmic backgrounds.
