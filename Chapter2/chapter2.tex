%Overview of different types of searches

The focus is on HNLs of the MeV-scale coupling to $|U_{\mu4}|^{2}$, probed by two experimental methods: peak searches and decay searches.

\subsection{Peak Searches}

\subsubsection{Pion Decay Spectrum Peak Searches}

\begin{coloritemize}
	\item \textbf{SIN} (Swiss Institute for Nuclear Research) \cite{SIN1, SIN2, SIN3} 
	\item The \textbf{PIENU} collaboration at TRIUMF \cite{PIENU}
\end{coloritemize}

\subsubsection{Kaon Decay Spectrum Peak Searches}

\begin{coloritemize}
	\item The \textbf{KEK} collaboration \cite{KEK1, KEK2}
	\item The \textbf{E949} collaboration \cite{E949}
	\item The \textbf{NA62} collaboration \cite{NA62A, NA62B}
\end{coloritemize}

\subsection{Decay Searches}

Decay searches look for decay products of the HNLs.
The HNLs are typically produced outside of the detector before reaching it, potentially decaying into observable SM particles within the detector.
Different combinations of production and decay channel yield distinct expected event rates and therefore, can probe different sensitivity regions associated with different mixing angles.
Decay searches have been historically performed in beam-dump experiments, which are explicitly designed to suppress the background from SM interactions in order to search for rare decay processes.
Recently, modern neutrino experiments with improved resolution can function as competitive beam-dump experiments alongside their neutrino physics programme.
For $|U_{\mu4}|^{2}$, the most competitive limits have been set by the following experiments:

\begin{coloritemize}
	\item The CERN \textbf{PS191} experiment \cite{PS191A, PS191B}
	\item The \textbf{T2K} collaboration \cite{T2KHNL}
	\item The \textbf{NuTeV} collaboration \cite{NuTeV}
	\item The \textbf{MicroBooNE} collaboration \cite{uboone1, uboone2, uboone3}	

\end{coloritemize}
